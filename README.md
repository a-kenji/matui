A Matrix TUI.

# Keybindings

There is no mouse support, but thankfully chat isn't terribly complicated.
Especially if you don't implement too many features.

## Chat Window

| Key   | Description                                            |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| j     | Select one message down.                               | 
| k     | Select one message up.                                 | 
| i     | Create a new message using the external editor.        | 
| Enter | Open the selected message (images, videos, urls, etc). | 
| c     | Edit the selected message in the external editor.      | 
| r     | React to the selected message.                         | 
| v     | View the selected message in the external editor.      |
